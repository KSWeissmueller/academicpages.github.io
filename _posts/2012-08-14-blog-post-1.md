Back home from the European Academy of Management’s annual conference [EURAM 2018](http://euramonline.org/annual-conference-2018) in beautiful Reykjavík, Iceland!

Together with my great co-authors Lode De Waele and Arjen van Witteloostuijn I am feeling extremely honored because we received the 2018 Best Paper Award of EURAM’s special interest group on Public and Non-Profit Management for our study on “The paradox of public bureaucracies: discriminatory bureaucrats in non-discriminatory bureaucracies”.

Many thanks to Reto Steiner and Andrea Bonomi Savignon (our wonderful programme chairs at PNPM SIG 2018!) as well as the sponsors of this award (IJPSM and Emerald Publishing)!
