I have the pleasure to announce that Gregg Van Ryzin, Sharon Gilad, and I will chair the  panel on “Behavioral and Experimental Public Administration” at the upcoming IRSPM 2019 conference, which will take place in beautiful Wellington (NZ) from 16 to 19 April 2019.

For a detailed description of our call for papers (panel P2) please follow this link: <http://irspm2019.com/files/docs/irspm18/gregg%20g.%20van%20ryzin.pdf> 

Theoretically, we are looking for papers that integrate public administration & management research with the perspective of behavioral science and psychological. Whilst this calls for a focus on micro-mechanisms, we’d be excited to also see papers that integrate micro and macro-level analyses. Methodologically, we hope to have a mix of papers that adopt experimental, observational — both quantitative or qualitative — and mixed-methods approaches. Projects at early stages, including experimental designs and pilot studies, are also most welcome.

We would like to encourage abstract submissions (500 words max.) to our panel P2 (“Behavioral and Experimental Public Administration”) by October 19th 2018 (submit here: <http://irspm2019.com/irspm19/call_for_abstracts>).

Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions!
