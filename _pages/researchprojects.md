I believe that the purpose of scholarship is to generate usable knowledge to solve real-life problems. In the spirit of open science, please feel free to contact me if you are interested in any of our projects!



<h2>Public Sector Corruption (CorPuS)</h2>

**A multi-country experimental study**

* *Research Objectives:*

Public sector corruption is a common, but severely understudied, phenomenon in Public Administration (PA). Prior studies have shown that public sector corruption – e.g., in the form of bribery and rule-breaking – causes inequality in access to public services. This inefficient allocation of resources and lack of accessibility equity seriously together seriously undermine the public’s trust in government and other public institutions (Getz & Volkema 2001). Researchers trying to examine the origins of public sector corruption traditionally use three different lenses, assuming that (1) the institutional context is accountable (Navot, Reingewertz, & Cohen 2016), (2) the organization is the key driving force (Frost & Tischer 2014), or (3) individual character traits determine deviant behavior (Bolino & Grant 2016). To date, there is neither sufficient empirical evidence supporting either lens, nor a unified theory of public sector corruption.

The *Public Sector Corruption (CorPuS)* project aims to advance theoretical insights and collect rich evidence about a few of the main underlying mechanisms of corruption and their interaction at the micro, meso, and macro level of behavior by conducting rigorous experimental research in fifteen countries.

Following recent calls by van Witteloostuijn (2016) and Walker, Lee, and James (2017) for more experimental work, we account for context effects by replicating our experimental study within different sets of countries, organizations, and populations. That is, our study involves a multi-lab design that involves replication and meta-analysis, employing both the method of agreement and difference (Walker et al. 2018). Furthermore, we hope to derive practical advice for public sector managers on ways to prevent corruption.

<h2>Risk in Public Private Partnerships (RiPPP)</h2>

**Behavioral experiments on Risk Preference, Risk Perception, and Risk Participation**

(May 2015 – June 2018)


* *Principal researcher & project manager together with*:  	<a href="https://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/en/fachbereich-sozoek/professuren/vogel-rick/team/vogel-rick.html">Rick Vogel</a>

* *Other Collaborators*: Robin Bouwman.

* *PhD-Project* at the  	<a href="https://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/en/fachbereich-sozoek/professuren/vogel-rick/forschung/forschungsprojekte/rippp.html">Chair of Public Management</a> funded by University of Hamburg

* *Research Objectives*:

Public organizations are often stigmatized in public opinion: Even though they are entrusted with the creation and maintenance of public goods and services, they are often perceived as slow and inefficient. This creates a number of issues for public agents especially in the complex setting of PPPs, ranging from practical challenges of cooperation to fundamental questions of legitimacy.
Why do people behave differently toward public organizations compared to private organizations? What are the consequences of this behavior for strategy in PPPs and for society as a whole?
In this project, we explore behavioral biases in the interaction of individual and corporate actors in the context of public-private partnerships. We introduce novel psychological and behavioral research methods such as z-Tree experiments and game theoretical approaches into PA and PM research to investigate the role of ‘publicness’ on strategic behavior in PPPs with a special focus on riks behavior, partner coordination, collaboration efficiency, and institutional compliance.

The findings of the *RiPPP* project
* will increase public welfare by enabling both public and non-public actors in PPPs to improve coordination and collaboration efficacy;
* will help to identify both favorable and unfavorable mechanisms of behavior and coordination and, based on these findings, to deduce practical strategic and operative advice for public managers – especially when put under pressure and in inferior negotiation positions;
* help actors to understand and cope with the emergence of irrational heuristic behavior in PPPs and cross-sectoral collaborations;
* shed light onto the cause and effects of latent micro-level aspects of coordination under risk asymmetry with a special focus on aagents’ individual characteristics;
* introduce novel psychological and neuro-economic research methods such as zTree experiments and economic experiments into behavioral public administration research.
