Project Goals and Objectives <a name="project_goal"></a>
=======

Public sector corruption is a critical yet severely understudied phenomenon in Public Administration (PA). Prior studies have shown that public sector corruption – e.g., in the form of bribery and rule-breaking – causes inequality in access to public services. This inefficient allocation of resources and lack of accessibility equity seriously together seriously undermine the public’s trust in government and other public institutions (Getz & Volkema 2001). Researchers trying to examine the origins of public sector corruption traditionally use three different lenses, assuming that (1) the institutional context is accountable (Navot, Reingewertz, & Cohen 2016), (2) the organization is the key driving force (Frost & Tischer 2014), or (3) individual character traits determine deviant behavior (Bolino & Grant 2016). To date, there is neither sufficient empirical evidence supporting either lens, nor a unified theory of public sector corruption.

The *Public Sector Corruption (CorPuS)* project aims to advance theoretical insights and collect rich evidence about a few of the main underlying mechanisms of corruption and their interaction at the micro, meso, and macro level of behavior by conducting rigorous experimental research in fifteen countries.

Following recent calls by van Witteloostuijn (2016) and Walker, Lee, and James (2017) for more experimental work, we account for context effects by replicating our experimental study within different sets of countries, organizations, and populations. That is, our study involves a multi-lab design that involves replication and meta-analysis, employing both the method of agreement and difference (Walker et al. 2018). Furthermore, we hope to derive practical advice for public sector managers on ways to prevent corruption.

Consortium <a name="consortium"></a>
=======

The CorPuS project is a non-commercial, non-commissioned pro-bono scientific research project driven by an international network of academic researchers who are passionate about understanding public sector corruption and about finding effective solutions for practice. The CorPuS project was initiated by Kristina S. Weißmüller, Lode De Waele, and Arjen van Witteloostuijn who also coordinate the project as principle investigators. Collectively, the CorPuS research consortium consists of 21 researchers based in 20 universities and academic research institutes in 15 countries <a href="https://ksweissmueller.github.io/files/CorPuS_world.png" style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" >worldwide</a>.

### <a href="http://www.kpm.unibe.ch/contact/personen/mitarbeitende/weissmueller_kristina/index_eng.html/">Kristina S. Weißmüller</a>

Kristina S. Weissmüller is a research assistant and lecturer at the KPM Center for Public Management. Before joining KPM, she was a doctoral candidate at Prof. Dr. Rick Vogel’s chair for Public Management, research associate at Helmut-Schmidt-Universität Hamburg, as well as an external lecturer at the University of Hamburg where she specialized in behavioral economics and experimental research methods. Her main research interest lies in the micro-foundations of corruption, strategic public management under risk (uncertainty and complexity) in PPPs, public service values and motivation, and fallacies of dysfunctional collaboration across sectors. Prior research projects addressed the psychological effects of public sector idiosyncrasies on individuals’ behavior – e.g. regarding risk taking, negotiation, PSM and leadership in higher education, as well as blaming, shaming, and accountability in public-private partnerships – with behavioral and economic research methods.

Currently, Kristinas main focus lies on conducting the CorPuS project.

Her research focuses on public administration and policy. Jeannette’s research on the public service in Australia and to a lesser extent, East Asia, is largely divided into two streams. The first focuses on productivity and performance matters. She has analysed the effects of performance measurement and reporting systems on employees’ behaviour and organisational outcomes, the utilisation of performance information for decision making within public organisations, and the productivity of the public sector. The second stream of research relates to human resource management issues. Jeannette has examined the effects of the government workplace on its employees’ work attitudes and actions, and they include recruitment, retention, and motivation issues. The second stream also include corruption and whistleblowing in the public sector.”
