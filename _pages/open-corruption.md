Course Description
--------

Public sector corruption is a critical yet severely understudied phenomenon in public administration and public management. Studies worldwide have shown that public sector corruption – e.g., in the form of bribery, rule-breaking, and deviant behavior – causes inequality in access to public services leading to discrimination and an inefficient allocation of resources. This lack of access equity seriously undermines the general public’s trust in government and public institutions (Getz & Volkema 2001).

Researchers trying to examine the origins of public sector corruption traditionally use three different lenses, assuming that (1) the institutional context is accountable (Navot, Reingewertz, & Cohen 2016), (2) the organization is the key driving force (Frost & Tischer 2014), or (3) individual character traits determine deviant behavior (Bolino & Grant 2016). To date, there is neither sufficient empirical evidence supporting either lens, nor a unified theory of public sector corruption.

The course *“Deviant Behavior and Corruption in the Public Sector”* aims to advance students’ practical and theoretical insights into a critical issue for public management worldwide. Focusing on the underlying mechanisms of individuals’ motivation this course shows how micro, meso, and macro factors interact in shaping people’s willingness to engage in bribery and their perception of rules and ethical behavior in bureaucracies.

This course comprises two topical focusses – *deviant behavior* and *corruption* – with 4 classes each, i.e. 8 classes in total. This course can be completed fully in a distance learning environment and it is mostly asynchronous as to be most inclusive for a broader audience of students by allowing for a self-controlled study experience that is flexible in time.
Each class comprises a short, recorded lecture as an introduction to the central issues and theoretical concepts. The online lecture is complemented by a set of instructions to direct self-study and further immersion though suggested scientific reading and written assignments. 

After each of the two topic blocks, course participants are invited to join the lecturer for a Zoom-meeting in a blended learning environment to discuss and reflect together on their findings in topical focus 1 and 2 respectively. This collaborative feedback will help prepare the consecutive short essays (5 pages + back and front matter), which are due 2 weeks later and which build upon the class assessments. 

-	First online session: 04th December 2020.
-	Second online session: 05th February 2021.

The Zoom-login data will be published through STiNE.

All course materials are available open access (prerecorded lectures, lecture slides, syllabus) for everybody interested. All course materials can be found [here](http://www.ksweissmueller.com/open-corruption/).



Learning objectives
--------

By participating in this course, students …
-	… will understand the origins and effects of different forms of deviant behavior and corruption in the public sector by identifying diverse current scientific positions on corruption, briber, discrimination, and (pro-social) rule-breaking.
-	… can argue about institutional differences and their effects on the acceptability of deviant behavior and corruption on the individual and systematic level. 
-	… will improve their ability to critically evaluate how public institutions can be designed to prevent corruption by nudging behavior and by creating resilient institutions. 
-	… derive meaningful practical advice for public sector managers on ways to prevent corruption based on scientific research outcomes. 
-	… will practice and improve their ability to write scientific essays. 


Assignments and Grading
--------

The workload for this course amounts to 6 ECTS and is similar to a 2 SWS seminar course. In order to receive these ECTS credit points, students need to register through STiNE (please make sure to complete registration within the official registration phases.

Students are required to submit **two (!) essays** with (5 pages + back and front matter *each*); this is one essay for each topical focus point each, i.e. one essay on deviant behavior in the public sector and another essay on corruption in the public sector. Please submit the essays to the [Academic Office](https://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/en/studienbuero-sozialoekonomie/service/service-studierende/abgabe-pruefungsunterlagen.html) as well as in .docx and .pdf-format to kristina.weissmueller@uni-hamburg.de. Please note that in accordance with WiSo examination regulations, plagiarism software might be used to evaluate the authenticity of the coursework submissions.

-	Deadline for submitting the first essay: 18th December 2020, 23h55.
-	Deadline for submitting the second essay: 19th February 2021, 23:55h.
