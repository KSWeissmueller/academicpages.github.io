_“Teaching without learning is futile”_


All of my courses are specifically designed in an interdisciplinary way synthesizing perspectives from micro- and macro-economics, management studies, sociology, and psychology to specifically accommodate the beauties and challenges of teaching in interdisciplinary educational programs. Creating an engaging, innovative, respectful and student-centered teaching environment is essential to foster students’ learning success.
<br>
I believe that teaching is as much an _essential a part of the profession of science_ as is conducting original research. Only by openly and pro-actively sharing our scientific insights with both students and practitioners, researchers can hope to make a meaningful contribution to the sustainable development of society and make a difference.
<br>
Teaching is a _collaborative process of knowledge generation_ and sharing that should engage students and lecturer(s) on equal terms and without hierarchy. Taking into account the heterogeneity of students, I believe that teaching university courses should be designed as an open process continuously striving for improvement through a _culture of respect and creativity_ between learners and lecturers. Knowledge is a living thing and teaching without learning is futile.
<br>
For me, _student-centered pedagogy_ means not merely implementing best practices and scientific insights on how university teaching works but actively recognizing students’ demands and challenges in order to design _courses that generate usable knowledge and relevant capabilities_. I believe in involving students in the process of scientific research from the very beginning of their degree programs – for instance, with seminars practically teaching the methods of social sciences by conducting actual research projects – _to help students develop a critical and open-minded perspective on the role of knowledge and science for society_, empowering students to think outside the box and realize the relevance of the contents taught.
<br>
Ideally, courses and lectures should be specifically designed in an interdisciplinary way and be co-taught by lecturers with diverse but complementary scientific backgrounds to contrast and synthesize the many theoretical perspectives of (social) sciences and teach relevant knowledge to solve the challenges of our times.
