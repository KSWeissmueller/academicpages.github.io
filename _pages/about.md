I am a scholar and lecturer of (behavioral) public administration and management at the <a href="https://www.kpm.unibe.ch/index_eng.html" >University of Bern in the KPM Center for Public Management</a>. Co-initiator and principal investigator of the multi-national <a href="http://www.corpus-project.org/" title="http://www.corpus-project.org/" style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" >CorPuS</a> research project. I specialized in quantitative-experimental and qualitative mixed-methods research. 

I study (1) public sector corruption – bribery and rule breaking – from a behavioral perspective, (2) the role of risk, uncertainty, and publicness in strategic decision making, for instance, in public-private partnerships, (3) the idiosyncrasies of public personnel motivation and leadership, (4) the role of complexity and cognitive biases in human decision making, e.g. in higher education, policy making, strategic negotiation, and consumption.

Currently, I focus on conducting a multi-national study to reveal the micro-foundations of public sector corruption and institutional deviance (<a href="http://www.corpus-project.org/" title="http://www.corpus-project.org/" style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" >CorPuS project</a>).
