Hi!

I am a scholar and lecturer of (behavioral) public administration and management, specialized in quantitative-experimental and qualitative mixed-methods research. Specifically, my research interest lies in issues of sustainable public management under risk (uncertainty & complexity), fallacies of dysfunctional collaboration across sectors, and the micro-foundations of organizational corruption. For instance, I research the psychological effects of public sector idiosyncrasies on individuals’ strategic choice – i.e. in situations of negotiation and accountability – to find out why, too often, public-private partnerships fail and what can be done about it.

Research interests: 
* Public sector corruption and motivation.
* Public-private partnerships, trust, and public sector negotiation.
* Strategic management and leadership under risk and complexity.
* Law and economics of policy, higher education, and consumption.
* Behavioral public administration; experimental and psycho-physiological research methods.

Currently, I am conducting a multi-national study to reveal the micro-foundations of public sector corruption and institutional deviance (<a href="http://www.corpus-project.org/" title="http://www.corpus-project.org/" style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" >CorPuS</a>).

Best,

Kristina
